# Reinforcement Learning-using-Deep-Q-Learning
This are the projects to train an agent using RL. All projects in this repo would be using OpenAI's Gym library.

The intent of this repository is to accumulate project that I perform as part of DQN on open-AI gym environments. The projects are inspired by the learnings I received in the ML specialisation that I did in the coursera/DeepLearning.ai .

Lunar Lander using DQN uses actions in discrete action space.
Car racing using DQN (code not working as of now), uses actions in discrete action space, with input as RGB image.
